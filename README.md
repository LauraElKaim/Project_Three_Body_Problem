## Three Body Problem

The goal of this project is to solve the Three Body Problem.

The Three Body Problem is a special case of the n-body problem. In astronomy, this problem consists in determining the motion of three celestial bodies moving under no other influence than their mutual gravitation.
   
Here, we will be interested by the sun, mars and the earth. And our starting point will be based on the initial positions and speeds, and also the masses of each of these bodies.

In few words, this problem consists in finding all the possible mathematical solutions to differential equations.  
These differential equations describe the movements of three stars attracting each other under the effect of gravity.
